Notes on compiling the code
---------------------------

This code uses the BOOST Graph Library for the underlying graph representations.
Therefore, you will need to get and install a copy of the BOOST library from 
http://www.boost.org.  This code has been compiled and tested against version 1.33.0 of the BOOST library, and GCC v3.4.3. 

Thanks!
